# ChurnMaster-End-to-End-Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-Synthetic-Data-Generation
A comprehensive project for predicting customer churn using machine learning, featuring synthetic data generation and full model development.

## Overview
**ChurnMaster** is a comprehensive project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. It covers the entire workflow, from generating a synthetic customer dataset to building and evaluating machine learning models. The project provides insights into how data-driven decisions can reduce churn and increase customer retention.

## Key Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creation of a realistic dataset that mimics customer behavior and churn patterns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and create new predictive features.
- **Model Building:** Implementation of various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation & Selection:** Rigorous evaluation using metrics like AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Interpretability:** Use of SHAP values to explain model predictions and enhance transparency.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churnmaster.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   
## Usage
- Data Generation: Use the `Data_Generation.ipynb` notebook to create a synthetic dataset tailored to customer churn analysis.
- EDA: Conduct exploratory analysis using `EDA.ipynb` to identify key patterns.
- Model Building: Train and evaluate various machine learning models with `Model_Building_and_Evaluation.ipynb`.

## Results
The project concluded with the Logistic Regression model as the best performer, achieving a balance of accuracy (72.3%) and interpretability (AUC-ROC: 0.70). The synthetic dataset effectively simulated real-world scenarios, aiding in model robustness.
